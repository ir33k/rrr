Nap is multi protocol CLI REST (REpresentational State Transfer)
Client, named "nap" because it is the best kind of rest *ba dum tss*.

Program reads standard input and sends it to server exactly as it
(with small exception in Gopher, see examples below).  The complete
lack of extra abstractions and logic between what you send and what
server receive was the goal of this project along with support for
multiple protocols.

Supported protocols:

	name    version   ssl
	------  --------  ---
	gopher
	http    HTTP/1.0
	https   HTTP/1.0  yes
	gemini            yes

Build and usage:

	$ ./build
	$ ./nap <file
